# Javascript Pong Game
Learning how to build a game using CSS ,JavaScript and Html.

# Pong Game
This application uses the left and right arrow keys on 
the keyboard to control the block at the bottom of the screen to hit the ball 
from one axis to another with in the div. You score points by hitting the blocks at the top
each block is wealth one point if all blocks have been remove you Win but if the ball hits the 
bottom of the board u Lose   

# Game Technologies
In this game I used a combination of technologies such as OOP for the construction
and assignment of blocks and there values along with various function and loops. The DOM was also used in the
development of the blocks, ball and the player platform block. Eventlistners are responsible for the input of controls from the keyboard 

# Challenges and Future Features
Some of the challenges was adding ball speed increase over time as the player continues to play. 
The start button still under development but still currently functional . Future potential features will be leaderboard ,reset button and more levels and higher diffcult as player progress
